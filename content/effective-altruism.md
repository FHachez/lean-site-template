# About Effective Altruism Brussels

Effective Altruism Brussels is a local group that falls under Effective Altruism Belgium. EA Belgium is a Belgian non-profit organization and the umbrella organization of all Belgian effective altruism groups, also including EA Flanders and EA KULeuven. Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to improve the world. Effective altruists aim to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity. While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies much more broadly, e.g., to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save and improve the most lives.
